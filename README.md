# Natural-Language-Process-Project

I was working as Research Analysis at Purdue Krannert Mangement School. In this project, I was responsible
for natural language processing to find insights and support a Krannert PHD's work. During the project, I translated billions of 
Thailand into English, utilized LDA and Kmeans algorithm to group people's interviews, did sentiment Analysis, and visulized results.
